# Personal Scripts
This is my personal script library. A lot of them will be quite messy, but will do the job just fine.
I'll document them as good as I can, but this isn't my job and a lot of them have been made on the side to aid my job or Homelab.

## PowerShell
`powershell/Run-SetupL2tpVpn.ps1` - This sets up a L2TP vpn using variables provided at the top of the script. Easy enough, was originally used to aid white-glove deployment of workstations.

## Bash
`bash/artemis-backups/backup_script.sh` - Backups my media host's configuration. Also provides a setup script located in `bash/artemis-backups/setup.sh`.
